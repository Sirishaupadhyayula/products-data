  \ during use There is no possible conent or harmful substanes or emissions under\
  \ normal condition of use. No environmental impact on the quality of water, air\
  \ or soil is expected due to the metal release from steel alloys were generally\
  \ very low. 1.13. Reference Service Life and Estimated Building Service Life Corrosion\
  \ resistance in cross-section parts of PosMAC\xAE, is superior to that of GI(H)\
  \ and galvalume. PosMAC\xAE also gets red-rust in cross-section parts when initially\
  \ exposed outdoors. However as the time goes by, the corrosion(red- rust) area of\
  \ PosMAC\xAE tends to decrease through the formation of its distinctive oxide-based\
  \ material(simonkolleite). If the thickness of PosMAC\xAE is more than 1.6mm, we\
  \ recommend post-treatment, because it is not fully covered by simonkolleite after\
  \ 1 year. In addition when the thickness of PosMAC\xAE is less than 1.6mm and cross-section\
  \ parts is clean without red-rust at initial construction, it is recommended to\
  \ carry out post-treatment by the option of the customers. Table 7. Estimation of\

  \ effects Fire: The product does not emit fumes or fire-gases.The critical temperature\
  \ for the integrity of the structure sustantially depends on component loading and\
  \ restraining conditions Water: No environmental impact on the quality of water,\

  \ very low. 1.15. Disposal Steel scrap has a relatively high economic value. Due\
  \ to the recycling cycle is well established for the steel industry, steel scrap\
  \ is not disposed of. 1.16. Further information Additional information on steel\

  \ ISO 21930:2017 2.3. Estimates and Assumptions POSCO provided all of the data for\
  \ estimating environmental impact of PosMAC \xAE through primary data based on measurement.\
  \ All primary data is provided as unit process data. Therefore, one can estimate\
  \ crate to gate data for each unit processes. One modifies the unit processes data\
  \ by input/output data for final process for PosMAC \xAE. It was not always possible\
  \ to distinguish intermediate flows for the packaging process. One example of this\
  \ is packaging. In order to avoid double counting of packaging impacts, total packaging\
  \ for all products was aggregated in the production site. Where the water inputs\
  \ and outputs did not balance, it was assumed the difference evaporated as water\
  \ vapor. The renewable wasted product is assumed to be used as a raw material for\
  \ reinforcing steel manufacturing. 2.4. Cut-off Criteria The cut-off criteria for\
  \ including or excluding materials, energy and emissions data of the study are as\
  \ follows: - Mass : If a flow is less than 1% of the cumulative mass of the model\
  \ it may be excluded, providing its environmental relevance is not a concern. The\
  \ total of neglected input flows per module shall be a maximum of 5% of mass. -\
  \ Energy : All the input energy is included in the calculation for environmental\
  \ impact. Environmental relevance : If a flow meets the above criteria for exclusion,\
  \ yet is thought to potentially have a significant environmental impact, it was\
  \ included. Material flows which leave the system (emissions) and whose environmental\
  \ impact is greater than 1% of the whole impact of an impact category that has been\
  \ considered in the assessment must be covered. This judgment was made based on\
  \ experience and documented as necessary. The total of neglected input flows per\
  \ module shall be a maximum of 5% of environmental impact. 2.5. Background data\
  \ Background data are sourced from Ecoinvent v2.2 Databases and USLCI. 2.6. Data\
  \ Quality Inventory data quality is judged by its precision (measured, calculated\
  \ or estimated), completeness (e.g., unreported emissions), consistency (degree\
  \ of uniformity of the methodology applied) and representativeness (geographical,\
  \ temporal, and technological). To cover these requirements and to ensure reliable\
  \ results, first-hand industry data in combination with consistent background LCA\
  \ information from the Ecoinvent v2.2 and USLCI were used. The LCI datasets from\
  \ the Ecoinvent v2.2 and USLCI database are widely distributed and used with the\
  \ SimaPro Software. The datasets have been used in LCA models worldwide in industrial\
  \ and scientific applications in internal as well as in many critically reviewed\
  \ and published studies. In the process of providing these datasets, they are cross-checked\
  \ with other databases and values from industry and science. | 14 | PosMAC\xAE STRUCTURAL\
